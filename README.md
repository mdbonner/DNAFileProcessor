 This program will perform various computations on genome sequence 			      
 files. The genome input file must be of FASTA format, with the accessionID	  
 at the top line and the entire genome sequence following immediately			    
 on the next line. Output files will be created for complementation,			    
 transcription, and translation computations.									                
 																				                                      
 Computations performed:														                          
 1. Count individual DNA nucleotides 											
 2. Compute and return the GC content of the genome							
 3. Complement and reverse a genome											
 4. Transcribe DNA sequence to RNA											
 5. Translate RNA sequence to proteins										
 6. Calculate the protein mass of the protein sequence						
 7. Count Hamming Distance (point mutations) between two DNA sequences		
 																				
 This program is continually being updated with new computations.
